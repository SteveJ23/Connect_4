		<h1>How To Play: </h1>
		<p>This game is a two player game where both play on the same board. Player one is red and player two is yellow(unless colors were changed in the settings). The first peice is placed down by player one. To place a piece down, click on the desired column, and the piece will be placed down in the lowest row available.</p>


		<h1>Rules: </h1>
		<p>A player places down one piece per turn. To win the game, a player must connect four peices of their color in row. This can be in any direction, right, left, and any diagnal direction. Once a game is won, if the registered player has one, the score will be kept and the leaderboard will update. To play again, you can hit the reset button.</p>
